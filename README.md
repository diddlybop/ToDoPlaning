# ToDoPlaning

## It is a planing application.

We are very open-minded to be corrected.
Please correct our code or give us some advice if there is the better way to code.

### Goal
1. Our first goal
1.1. "To do List" with calendar.

### Program flow
1. Log in
2. Show calendar with "To do list"

### JSON format
```
{
    user: {
        date: {
            todo: ...,
            todo: ...,
            todo: ...,
                .
                .
                .
        }
    }
}
```

### Coding rule

2. Use tab to indent.

### Git
